== Bugs ==
 - RAM disk should have separate folder depending on server name
 - It put someone in flatland instead of in the world
 - Add option to enable death by default
 - No cheat plus blocking block breaks

 - DIDN'T COPY NEW FOLDERS CORRECTLY FOR MINIGAMES RESOURCES

== New Ideas ==
 - PVP in hub (with hiscores)
 - Item to show all games in progress and lobbies
 - Item to join other players / friends
 - Parkour (timed 1/2 player minigame first, then hub)
