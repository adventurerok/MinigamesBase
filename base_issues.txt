== New Idea ==
Minigames Plugin:
 - One specific command lets console execute commands
 - Communicates with the minigames controller
 - RAM disk should have separate folder depending on server name

Minigames controller:
 - Keeps track of which servers are running which minigames, and commands them
 - Provides stats for all minigames (num players, etc...)
 - Manipulates bungee servers
 - Records minigame errors
