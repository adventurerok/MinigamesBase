== Bugs ==
 - RAM disk should have separate folder depending on server name
 - It put someone in flatland instead of in the world
 - Add option to enable death by default
 - No cheat plus blocking block breaks

 - DIDN'T COPY NEW FOLDERS CORRECTLY FOR MINIGAMES RESOURCES

== New Idea ==
Minigames Plugin:
 - Does everything

Minigames controller:
 - Keeps track of which servers are running which minigames, and commands them
 - Provides stats for all minigames (num players, etc...)
 - Manipulates bungee servers
 - Records minigame errors
